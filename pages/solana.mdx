## Seamless Blockchain Integration

One of the standout features of Lands of Ascension is its integration with the Solana blockchain. This integration is designed to be seamless and user-friendly, allowing players to benefit from blockchain technology without requiring in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies or blockchain operations.

## Backend Blockchain Tracking

Behind the scenes, all in-game actions are done on-chain, while pre-checked by our API before sending transactions. There is a handler that creates a wallet for each player and performs all blockchain interactions in a secure and transparent manner. This provides transparency, security, and provable scarcity for in-game assets and resources. Players are not required to initiate or confirm blockchain transactions manually.

## User Wallet Options

Player can view their in-game wallet on Solana blockchain explorers like [Solscan](https://solscan.io) and even add funds or NFTs puchased on [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/) to help players in different game modes.
